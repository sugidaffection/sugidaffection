### 🦀 Yo, I’m Sugi — Rust & Open Source Dev

📌 **About Me**  
- Focused on the **Rust ecosystem** — Leptos, Dioxus, Axum, Bevy.  
- Love building **full-stack apps** on a modern & free stack: Rust + Cloudflare Workers + Supabase.  
- Write **private libraries** for FFI (C/Node.js via N-API) and occasionally polish them for open source.  
- Past life in **Python (Flask, SQLAlchemy, LangChain)** and **Angular (since v7 in 2018 → v20 today)**.  
- Tinkered with Yew and early Rust game engines back in the day, but Rust has been home since 2018.

📂 **Projects & What I’m Building**

Most of my early public repos were experiments — e.g. a *Super Mario* clone and `rs-piston` ( used for learning).  
These days my focus is more practical and modern:

- 🦀 **Rust-first dev** — Leptos, Axum, Dioxus for fullstack/frontend.  
- 🔗 **FFI + N-API bridges** — connecting Rust libraries with other runtimes.  
- ☁️ **Cloudflare Workers + Supabase** — serverless apps with real-time DBs.  
- 🛠️ **Private utilities** — small Rust libraries I rely on, some gradually becoming open source.  

*(Expect more Rust-driven tools and apps showing up here soon 🚀)*

🔧 **TL;DR**  
I build with Rust, scale with Cloudflare/Supabase, and leave breadcrumbs for future-me (who is usually confused).
